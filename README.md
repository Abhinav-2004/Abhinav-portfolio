# 💼 Abhinav's Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio built using **React** and **Vite**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and deployed on **Vercel**. The site showcases my projects, skills, and contact information in a clean, responsive design.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React** (via [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)) — Fast and modern front-end tooling
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Vercel** — Hosting platform with CI/CD for seamless deployment
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**

## ✏️ How to Update Content

To update portfolio content (projects, skills, contact info, etc.):

1. Navigate to:

   ```
   src/constants/constants.js
   ```

2. Modify the relevant arrays/fields:

   - `projects`
   - `skills`
   - `socials`
   - `about`

3. Save the file — Vite will hot reload your changes locally.

⚠️ No need to touch component or layout files for basic content updates.
